# [Kotlin for Java Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers/) course

**About this Course**
The Kotlin programming language is a modern language that gives you more power for your everyday tasks. Kotlin is concise, safe, pragmatic, and focused on interoperability with Java code. It can be used almost everywhere Java is used today: for server-side development, Android apps, and much more. Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling support. Itâ€™s a pragmatic language with a very low learning curve, and can be quickly grasped by Java developers. Kotlin code might be compiled not only to JVM bytecode but to JavaScript and Native code as well, but this course is focused on Kotlin/JVM.

This course aims to share with you the power and the beauty of Kotlin. We'll have a basic overview of the language, as well as a discussion of many corner cases, especially concerning Java interoperability. The course is based on your Java experience; it shows the similarities between the two languages and focuses on what's going to be different. 
Note that this course won't cover the programming fundamentals. We'll discuss: basic syntax, nullability, functional programming with Kotlin, object-oriented programming with Kotlin, the power of the Kotlin standard library, and Java interoperability.

## Week 2
 * isValidIdentifier - function that checks whether a string is a valid identifier.
 * SumExtensionFunction - sum of `List<Int>` as an extension function.
 * Mastermind - an evaluator for the [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) game.

## Week 3
 * isEmptyOrNull - an extension function on the type `String?`; it return true, if the string is null or empty.
 * InterchangeablePredicates -  functions `allNonZero` and `containsZero` implemented 
using `all`, `none` and `any` predicates in turn.
 * NiceString - function to check if a string is "nice".
 A string is nice if at least two of the following conditions are satisfied:           
   * It doesn't contain substrings `"bu"`, `"ba"` or `"be"`;
   * It contains at least three vowels (vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'` and `'u'`);
   * It contains a double letter (at least two similar letters following one another).
 * TaxiPark - is the class that stores information about registered drivers, passengers, and their trips;
   TaxiParkTask - a set of six functions which collect different statistics about the data.
   
## Week 4
 * Rational - a class representing rational numbers 
 and a couple of auxiliary functions.
 * Board and BoardImpl - interfaces SquareBoard and GameBoard with their 
 corresponding implementations.
 
 ## Week 5
 * Game2048 and GameOfFifteen - implementations of 
 [the Game 2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) and
 [the Game of Fifteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) respectively.
